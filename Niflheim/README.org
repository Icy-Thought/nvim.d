* Greetings from NVIM! ðŸŒ’
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
*Announcement for the future*:
My nvim configuration will be re-written in Fennel because of lisp being a more
appealing language than Lua.

Whenever that occurs -> say your farewell to our beloved Emacs.
Why? Because Emacs is not a text editor and what I want is a text editor.
#+END_QUOTE

At the time of writing, the Neovim configuration files contained within the =lua= folder mostly consists of the recommended settings mentioned in the =README.md= of the installed plugins, while the remaining modifications belong to myself and other Neovim users. (=Ayamir's nvimdots=, =Abzcoding's lvim= & =Neovim From Scratch (LunarVim)=)

* Sections
Safety feature was added to the first configuration file that attempted to called ~local x = require('x)~ because of how Nix (Home-Manager) handles the Neovim config. To explain this, using Neovim through Home-Manager will generate *ONE* large file containing all the plugin configurations placed inside ~config/nvim~ -> omits the need to re-define it and create a non-useful boilerplate block.
#+begin_src lua
local function prequire(...)
    local status, lib = pcall(require, ...)
    if (status) then return lib end
    return nil
end
#+end_src
