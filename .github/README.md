# Neovim Dotfiles

This repository consists of:

1. `niflheim`: a configuration I stitched together with the help of the default
   settings of the installed plugin mentioned in the project's README.

2. `Butchered-NVIM`: as of the time of writing, it's a broken fennel-based
   configuration I'll rewrite once I have spare time to migrate into a
   lisp-based neovim setup. ðŸŒ’
