# Neovim Dotfiles

This repository consists of:

1. `niflheim`: a configuration I stitched together with the help of the default
   settings of the installed plugin mentioned in the project's README.

2. ereshkigal: lisp-based neovim setup. 

3. agasaya: lua-based neovim setup. 

# Ereshkigal

![ereshkigal](./assets/png/ereshkigal.png)

`Ereshkigal` is a fennel-based Neovim setup based on
[Nyoom.nvim](https://github.com/shaunsingh/nyoom.nvim)!

> **Note** This repository will go through a rework in the future to match the
> behaviour of my current lua-based neovim configuration.
